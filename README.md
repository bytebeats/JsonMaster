# JsonMaster
Json Master is a lightweight plugin for validating and formatting JSON strings and generating a Class from a JSON strings.

Tired of opening a browser to validating and formatting JSON?<br>
Annoyed of generating a Class of Java/Kotlin/Dart from JSON?<br>
Why don't you install Json Master and do the job inside the IDEA with offline support?<br>
Try install it and spread the word :)<br>
